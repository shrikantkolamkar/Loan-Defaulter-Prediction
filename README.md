# Credit Risk Prediction and Risk Minimization Strategy

## Problem Statement
### Predictive Modeling
Model Development: Build a model to predict credit risk using statistical or machine learning techniques.
Model Validation and Optimization: Validate and optimize the model for accuracy and reliability.

### Risk Minimization Strategy
Risk Assessment: Evaluate and quantify the risk associated with each loan applicant using the model.
Approval Strategy Development: Develop strategies to balance risk minimization with approving a high number of safe loans.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifiers
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Introduction
This case study aims to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real business scenario within the banking and financial services sector. The objective is to understand how data analytics can be leveraged to minimize the risk associated with lending to customers.

## Business Understanding
When a loan application is received, the lending company must make a decision based on the applicant's profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank's decision:
1. Not approving the loan for an applicant capable of repayment results in a loss of business.
2. Approving the loan for an applicant likely to default may lead to financial loss for the company.

## Insights from Data Analysis
1. Cash loan takers are more likely to default on payments.
2. Men are more frequent defaulters than women.
3. Parents with six or more children are prone to become defaulters.
4. People living in rented apartments or with their parents are likely to default.
5. The age group of 20-40 has a higher probability of defaulting.
6. Higher loan amounts between 300k and 700k have a higher default rate.
7. Unemployed individuals or those on maternity leave have a higher default risk.
8. Lower secondary education holders have a higher default probability.
9. Civil marriage, single, or separated individuals are more likely to default.
10. Certain occupations such as low-skill laborers, drivers, waiters, etc., have a higher default rate.
11. More family members correlate with a higher likelihood of default.
12. Single individuals accompanied by a group in the loan application are more likely to default.
13. Marital status and housing type also influence default probabilities.

## Suggestions for Risk Minimization
Based on the insights obtained, the following strategies can be developed to minimize risk:
- Implement stricter criteria for cash loan approvals.
- Adjust loan approval criteria based on gender.
- Scrutinize applications from parents with larger families more thoroughly.
- Develop targeted marketing strategies for low-risk demographics.
- Utilize occupation and education data to refine loan approval processes.
- Implement risk-based pricing for loan products.
- Explore partnerships with employers for income verification.
